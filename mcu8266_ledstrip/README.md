Circuit design has a few different variations as I tried new tools.

- V1 is in Fritzing
- V2 is in Altium circuit maker (Cloud)
- V3 is in Kicad (pretty happy with it, awkward for jlpcb assembly) - Components can be downloaded from snapeda.com
- V4 is in EasyEDA

Circuit boards are ordered from jlcpcb.com
